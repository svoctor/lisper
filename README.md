# Lisper
Basic Lisp interpreter, implemented in Rust.

This is a project to learn Rust, inspired and based on the great work of [Stepan](https://stopa.io/post/222) and the original post from [Norvig](http://norvig.com/lispy.html). There is also a fair bit of foundational curiosity that came from [Ronin](https://github.com/hundredrabbits/Ronin), by the great [Hundred Rabbits](https://100r.co/).
